Obstacle Avoiding Robot Car 🚗🚨
Using an Arduino Uno and an Ultrasonic sensor.

Obstacle Avoiding robot is a fascinating project that combines programming and hardware. 
The Robot is a small mobile machine that avoids obstacles, and it does so through an ultrasonic sensor that will detect the distance of the objects in front of it and make decision about its trajectory. 
When approaching a certain distance, the Arduino UNO will send a signal and with the help of an L293D motor control shield will cause the engines to turn the car and therefore avoid the obstacle. 

Components :
1- Arduino UNO 
2- L293D Motor Driver Shield 
3- 2 x car chassis 
4- 4 x DC Motor 
5- 4 x wheel Robot Car Kit 
6- 18650 Battery Holder – 4 Cell 
7- 3 x 18650 Battery Cell 3.7V or 2 x 18650 Battery Cell 3.7V
8- SG90 Servo Motor 
9- Ultrasonic Sensor Holder 
10- Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 
11- Jumper Wires
